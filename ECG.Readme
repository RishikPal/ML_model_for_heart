# ðŸ“ˆ ECG Signal Processing Workshop

This repository contains MATLAB resources and signal processing workflows for analyzing **Electrocardiogram (ECG)** signals. It demonstrates essential techniques for ECG preprocessing and fiducial point detection using an enhanced **Pan-Tompkins algorithm**.

---

## ðŸ“– Overview

An **Electrocardiogram (ECG)** records the heart's electrical activity and is widely used to detect heart rhythm abnormalities and various cardiovascular diseases. This project focuses on processing ECG signals to accurately detect key waveforms: **P, Q, R, S, T peaks**.

## ðŸ“Š Workflow Summary

1. **DC Removal & Normalization**
   - Remove baseline offset.
   - Normalize signal amplitude.

2. **Filtering**
   - Apply Low-Pass and High-Pass filters to remove noise and baseline drift.
   - Use Derivative and Squaring operations to enhance QRS complexes.

3. **Moving Window Integration**
   - Smooth squared signal for peak detection.

4. **Adaptive Thresholding**
   - Dynamically identify QRS complex regions.

5. **Fiducial Point Detection**
   - Detect R-peaks, followed by Q, S, T, and P peaks within cardiac cycles.
